# rebound-github-learning
I'm currently using the repository for two things. I will mostly be doing simple work involving the REBOUND N-body simulation software. I will also be learning the basics of using GitHub.

Much of the code that's found here can be found in it's original form [here.](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound)

# planned changes
After I get a grasp of how version control works in GitHub, I'll make a changelog to keep track of my progress.
